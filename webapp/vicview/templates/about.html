      Our Mission
    </h3>
    <p>
    Regional Institutions offer a wide variety of courses in different disciplines, however, due to their remote location, there is an assumption that these institutes do not offer proper amenities for students, and living conditions in those areas would be sub-standard as compared to those available in metropolitan regions. In reality, some suburbs in regional Victoria have excellent facilities for students, which go unused every year.
    VicView was developed We want to help more students know about regional Institutions, and the courses they offer. We also want to assist them in finding ideal suburbs that they can call home. This will spread awareness among year 12 students in metropolitan areas, of the many options available to them in the future, and will subsequently lead to the upliftment of regional areas.
